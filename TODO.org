** Better Literate Programming
*** TODO [#A] Org-Transclusion with Zettels in Literate Programming
To keep notes atomic but to also reference code blocks and documentation from them in a bigger work.
*** TODO [#A] Automate creating a workflow in which you create projects per chapter of a "book" and run the codeblocks
So don't have to worry about the org-babel way of doing things vs the actual way and can implement TDD, TCR, use LSP and DAP and Moldable and whatever else. Make sure that this can also work with the zettelkasten approach and that the source zettel can be easily changed with a keypress and menu.
*** TODO [#A] Export to Interactive Environment
A website or whatever else where others can run the code, interact with it, and answer quiz questions after each section that uses space repetition and maybe AI-generated questions or review sections.
*** TODO [#A] Live Collaboration with TCR
Have everyone make changes in the same org document as if it were google docs and have saving the code blocks trigger TCR with the appropiate tests, biggest issue would be annotating when a test is purposely created to be a failing test and making sure that such a test does not overwrite someone else's valid code.
*** TODO [#A] Autoactivating Snippets
For both org-mode and also programming languages themselves
*** TODO [#A] Avy Integration
So that one can modify or execute a code block that the cursory currently isn't on, maybe have an option to press a key that brings up a vertico menu if the desired codeblock is not on the screen yet.
*** TODO [#C] AI Assistant 
AI powered by Gptel Tools that integrates with the usual Consult etc. stack and gets data from LSP, DAP, Moldable, Treesitter, Github, etc.
*** TODO [#A] Static Analysis Section
A section which has a visual/interactive section with graphs created by static analysis of the code and telemetry
*** TODO [#A] Automate creating 12-Factor Applications
*** TODO [#A] Posframe the entire org-mode menu
Agenda, inserting skeleton, C-c C-s, etc.
